‚Ä¢ Data types are types but they can also be represented as a value;  
‚Ä¢ You can use ‚Äú`<<...types>>`‚Äù in some cases to enforce a type;  
‚Ä¢ If the type can be `void` you can put a `?` after it;  
‚Ä¢ Functions or classes can be used as types.

## `void`
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è nothing‚Ä¶

## `ref`
‚Ä¢ Passed or not before another type;  
‚Ä¢ Receives a variable.

## `any`
Literally any  type.

## `num`
`int` or `float`

## `int`
‚Ä¢ Use **dots** to separate decimal places.  
`1.000.000.000` *; A billion*


## `float`
‚Ä¢ Use **commas** to separate decimal numbers from fluctuation numbers.  
`1.000,12` *; One thousand point twelve*

## `str`
‚Ä¢ Use simple quotes or double quotes;  
‚Ä¢ Its prototype has a method called `eval` that evaluates its content.

`‚Äòsingle quotes string‚Äô`  
`"double quotes string"`  
`'12 + 2'.eval()` *; same as 14*

## `ch`
‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs a string with only one character.
`a`

## `bool`
`true` and `false`

## `list`
‚Ä¢ List contains only the same type of values;  
‚Ä¢ To use different types enforce it;  
‚Ä¢ Values are separated by comma;  
‚Ä¢ You can get a value thus: `<list>[<number>]`.  
`[ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]`  
`[ 1, 2, 3, false, 5 ]`

## Function
`<return type>(<...?argument's types>)`
