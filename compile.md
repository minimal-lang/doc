# Compiling

```
min compile <?platform> <file>
```

## Platforms
- win (generates a `.exe`);
- lin (generates a linux binary file).

<br>

You can also run directly (like Go does by _`go run <file>`_)

```
min run <file>
```

It will run `min compile <file>`, put it in a temporary folder and run it.
